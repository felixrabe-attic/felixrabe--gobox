gobox: Busybox-alike in Go
==========================

This is an experiment, inspired by Busybox and Go.

-   Like Busybox, this includes a shell and built-in commands.

-   This can run from a Docker `scratch` image.

-   It sports a [concurrent REPL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26198280/how-does-erlangs-eshell-keep-the-input-line-unaffected-by-async-output).

-   It gives you control over a Linux machine.

-   Unlike Busybox, both shell and commands are vastly different.

-   This project is related to the more experimental side of [Bashsh](https://github.com/mcrio/bashsh).
